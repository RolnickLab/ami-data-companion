### Dependencies


- Requires Python 3.10. Use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) if you need to maintain multiple versions of Python or are unfamiliar with using Python and scientific packages, it is especially helpful on Windows. [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is also a popular tool for managing multiple versions of python if you are familiar with the command line.
- Requires Git to clone the source code and stay up-to-date with the latest changes. Anaconda comes with Git, but the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application works well if you are less familiar with Git. 

### Installation (for non-developers)

Install (or upgrade) the package with the following command

```sh
pip install --editable "git+https://github.com/RolnickLab/ami-data-manager.git#egg=trapdata"
```

Optionally test the installation with the following command

```sh
trapdata-test
```

### Installation (for developers)

Create an environment just for AMI and the trapdata manager using conda (or virtualenv) 

```sh
conda create -n ami python=3.10 anaconda
```

Clone the repository using the command line or the GitHub desktop app.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:RolnickLab/ami-data-manager.git
```

Install as an editable package. This will install the dependencies and install the `trapdata` console command

```sh
cd ami-data-manager 
pip install -e .
```

Test the whole backend pipeline without the GUI using this command

```sh
python trapdata/tests/test_pipeline.py
```

### Usage

- Make a directory of sample images to test & learn the whole workflow more quickly.

- Launch the app by opening a terminal and then typing the command ```trapdata```. You may need to activate your Python 3.10 environment first (`conda activate ami`).

- When the app GUI window opens, it will prompt you to select the root directory with your trapdata. Choose the directory with your sample images.

- The first time you process an image the app will download all of the ML models needed, which can take some time. _The status is only visible in the console!_

- **Important:** Look at the text in the console/terminal/shell to see the status of the application. The GUI may appear to hang or be stuck when scanning or processing a larger number of images, but it is not. For the time being, most feedback will only appear in the terminal.

- All progress and intermediate results are saved to a local database, so if you close the program or it crashes, the status will not be lost and you can pick up where it left off.

- The cropped images, reports, cached models & local database are stored in the "user data" directory which can be changed in the Settings panel. By default, the user data directory is in one of the locations below, You 

    macOS: 
    ```/Library/Application Support/trapdata/```

    Linux:
    ```~/.config/trapdata```

    Windows:
    ```%AppData%/trapdata```
